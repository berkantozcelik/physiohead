# Legal Brief for Counsel (PhysioHead SIG Initiative)

## 1) Purpose of this request
We are building an international, non-profit-oriented SIG initiative website (PhysioHead) focused on education, collaboration, and white-paper/publication outputs in headache care.  
We need the legally safest and operationally simplest structure to accept and manage project-based funding internationally.

## 2) Current status (as-is)
- Website is live as an informational/professional initiative.
- Content includes mission, members, activities, funding page, and white paper draft page.
- We are not yet set up as a standalone legal entity.
- We want to avoid legal/financial risk while allowing international collaboration and funding.

## 3) Main question for legal counsel
What is the lowest-friction, lowest-risk legal path to receive and manage funds for an international collaborative SIG before (or without) creating a separate legal entity?

## 4) Working model under consideration
**Preferred initial model:** Fiscal sponsorship (or equivalent host institution model) through an established legal entity that can:
- receive grants/donations,
- contract service providers,
- run compliance checks (AML/sanctions/anti-bribery),
- issue compliant financial reports.

Please confirm whether this is the best first-stage model for our case and jurisdictions.

## 5) Key legal points we need advice on
1. **Legal structure**
   - Fiscal sponsor vs. creating a standalone nonprofit now.
   - Cross-border implications (EU/UK/US and other countries where collaborators are based).
2. **Funding acceptance and restrictions**
   - Which funding sources are acceptable/not acceptable.
   - Donation/grant agreement language and risk terms.
3. **Governance and independence**
   - Conflict-of-interest policy requirements.
   - Scientific/editorial independence clauses.
4. **Contracts and IP**
   - Ownership/licensing of white papers, figures, website content, and branding.
   - Contributor agreements and publication rights.
5. **Data/privacy and website compliance**
   - Minimum required website legal documents now (disclaimer, terms, privacy/cookies if needed).
   - Contact form/data retention obligations.
6. **Liability and insurance**
   - Liability exposure for clinical/scientific statements.
   - Recommended disclaimers and any insurance needs.
7. **Tax and reporting**
   - Tax treatment and reporting responsibilities under proposed model.
   - Any jurisdiction-specific filing obligations.

## 6) What we need from counsel (deliverables)
Please provide:
1. A recommended legal/governance model for **next 12 months**.
2. A list of minimum documents we must adopt immediately.
3. Draft clause checklist for:
   - funding agreements,
   - COI policy,
   - scientific independence statement,
   - IP/contributor terms.
4. A risk matrix (high/medium/low) with top “do first” actions.

## 7) Practical constraints
- We need a lightweight start model (fast to implement, low admin burden).
- We need to preserve scientific credibility and neutrality.
- We expect multicountry collaborators and potentially multicountry funders.

Subject: Legal Structuring Advice Request – International SIG Funding Model (PhysioHead)

Hello [Name],

We are building PhysioHead, an international SIG-style collaborative initiative (non-pharmacological headache care) with activities including publications and education.  
We need legal advice on the safest and simplest way to accept and manage project-based international funding before creating (or without creating) a standalone legal entity.

Our current preferred option is starting under a fiscal sponsor/host institution model.  
Could you advise on the optimal structure and required minimum legal framework (funding agreements, COI/independence, IP/contributor terms, website legal compliance, tax/reporting, and liability controls)?

I can share our site structure and planned outputs immediately if helpful.

Thank you,  
[Name]
